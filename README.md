## My process

- Started with building out the HTML structure
- Added all the base styles needed to make it look as close to the design file as possible
- Added media query to make it look good on smaller mobile devices

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make this design into an actual website, even though it wasn't that difficult I still managed to get myself in a spot where I had to research some stuff I wasn't familiar with, but in the end I managed to get it to look the way I wanted

### Continued development

At this point in time I'm quite confident in myself that if I was to attempt another challenge of this calliber I would finish it even faster. But I'm quite sure that there are things that I could improve upon, that I don't necessarily know of as of yet.
